    <h2> <u> YOUR IDENTITY</u></h2>
    <p>
      Hello friends, your identity is what definds you, it's the distinguishing character or personality of an
      individual, it's what you are known
      for. You can't claim to have christ and people don't know about it, what kind of christain are you?
      probably if I ask you right now 'WHO ARE YOU?' You will either tell me your name or your proffession or your
      educational qualifications, NO!!!...thats not who you are those are additional identification as related to the
      world. Our first identity is in christ (colossians 3:3 <span style="color: aqua;"> <i> For you died, and your life
          is
          now hidden with christ
          and christ in God</i></span> )
      <p>The big question is 'WHERE IS YOUR HEART?' (mattew 6:21<span style="color: aqua;"> <i>For where your treasure
            is, there will your heart be also.</i></span>)
        Your identity is always tied to where you give your heart to.
        What have you allowed to define you? Something or someone will have first place in your heart but when you find
        your identity in the one who created you it will change your whole perspective.</p>
      <p>
        It is very neccesary to make it clear who you are, if you are a christain, let everyone know, your friends,
        your colleagues, I mean everyone. Don't be a double minded man because you will be unstable in all your ways,
        don't be those christains that says
        when i'm in rome I act like a roman, when i'm in jerusalem I act like a jew. NO.. you don't have an identity or
        you have lost your identity.
        Friends, God knows his people, if you have lost you identity say this prayer after me <i
          style="color: aqua;">LORD JESUS FORGIVE ME
          MY SINS, I WANT TO FIND MY IDENTITY IN YOU, FROM THIS DAY I ACCEPT YOU AS MY LORD AND PERSONAL SAVIOR. THANK
          YOU JESUS AMEN</i>
        You are now born again glory to GOd. Congratulations!!!
